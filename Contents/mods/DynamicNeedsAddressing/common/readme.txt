*** What The Junk - assign item's display category ***

Is your spoon classified as a deadly weapon? Is your pillow a survival tool? You bet it is… but not anymore. With this mod every single item can now be re-categorized to something that makes sense (or doesn't - your call). You can finally take full control of your inventory’s chaos. No more “Weapon - Melee” spoons. No more “Junk” treasures.

Setup

Works out of the box. No config. No setup. It is though advised to keep the mod at the bottom of your mod load order (that's by default when you add it, but adding more mods would move it later up in the list and that may cause problems)

How To Use

Right-click on any item in your inventory. Select “Assign Category” Pick a new category from the list. NOTE! The changes are not immediate and require reload due to the way the engine works, the display categories depend on the items' script files which cannot be changed during runtime (in-game).

Compatibility

This mod does not override vanilla scripts or items. Safe to add/remove anytime - no savefile carnage involved. Tested on Build 42. 

Known Issues

None known, although this mod was essentially vibe-coded in about 24 hours and the code is all over the place, so if you find any bugs, please do report it!
